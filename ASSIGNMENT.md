# Styra Frontend Engineer Exercise

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your software engineering and
frontend web development expertise.

We donâ€™t expect you to do all of the heavy lifting, but we want to see _your_
work so avoid using off-the-shelf components for the meat of your solution. You
should be able to complete this exercise using native JavaScript and browser
APIs alone; but using libraries (like d3, jQuery, lodash, ...) and frameworks
(like AngularJS, React, Vue.js, ...) is reasonable, especially if you want to
demonstrate core proficiency with such technologies.

We have provided a skeleton for your solution, which you can extend and modify:

  - index.html
  - script.js
  - style.css

## Problem

### Part A

Display a set of nodes in a table.

### Part B

Make the table sortable.

### Part C

Scale your solution to Parts A and B to tens of thousands of nodes. Your goal is
to avoid pauses and hangs while the table renders so that the table is quickly
displayed to the user yet allows them to scroll through the data naturally.

There are a half dozen ways to approach this problem. Have fun, think of as many
solutions as you can, and choose one that elegantly and comprehensively
illustrates your mastery.

Good luck!
